## Rom Shuffler
This application allows you to reduce choice paralysis when it comes to playing a game. 

---

### Installation
* Copy the contents inside `rom_shuffle` into the `/Roms/APPS` folder on your SD Card.
* Delete both `LICENSE` and `README.md` files.
* Launch the application.

### Removal
* Delete the `Rom Shuffle.sh` file and the `Rom Shuffle` folder.

### Adding exclusions
For any reason you would like to exclude certain ROMs you can edit the `EXCLUDE.txt` file inside the `Rom Shuffle` folder. Place the name of the folder you want excluded from `Roms` on a separate line. By default I have excluded `APPS`, `VIDEOS`, `MANUALS`, and `THEMES`. However feel free to edit how you like.
