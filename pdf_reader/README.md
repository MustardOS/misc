## PDF Reader
This modification allows you to read all your PDF manuals _(or fan fiction...)_

---

### Installation
* Copy the `MANUALS` folder into your `Roms` folder on your SD Card.
* You should now see a `MANUALS` icon in GarlicOS.
* Make sure you have a couple of PDFs in the `PDF` folder.
* Run the `Install` entry and this will create all the required files.
* If you are using dual SD Cards you can copy the `MANUALS` folder over on that too.

### Removal
* Remove the `MANUALS` folder from the `Roms` folder.

---

### Creating PDF Entries
* Each PDF entry has a PDF Updater that will refresh the list of PDFs.
* Remember the extension **MUST** have `.pdf` in lower case.
* You may also see a `fbpdf` file, that is the actual program to view the PDFs.
 * _Do not delete this or you will be a sad panda!_
